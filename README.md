# Chess Games Analysis

This repository contains a script for analyzing chess games from a PGN (Portable Game Notation) file. The script extracts various insights and statistics from the games and visualizes them using graphs.

## Features

- Extracts and analyzes game results (wins, losses, draws).
- Tracks rating changes over time for both White and Black players.
- Analyzes the frequency and success rates of different chess openings.
- Examines the distribution of time controls used in the games.
- Provides performance statistics for each color (White and Black).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ismat-Samadov/chess_games_analyse.git
   cd chess_games_analyse
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Update the PGN file path in the script:**
   In `main.py`, replace `'path_to_your_pgn_file.pgn'` with the actual path to your PGN file.

2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. **Output:**
   - The script will print various insights to the console:
     - Overall game results.
     - Total number of games.
     - Performance by color.
     - Top 10 openings and their frequencies.
     - Win rates by opening.
   - The script will generate and display several plots:
     - Bar chart of game results.
     - Line plot of rating changes over time.
     - Bar chart of the top 10 openings.
     - Bar chart of time controls used.
   - A CSV file named `parsed_lichess_games.csv` will be saved in the current directory, containing all parsed game data.
